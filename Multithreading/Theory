Multitasking: When multiple application performs simultaneously is called multitasking.

Multithreading: Multithreading is the process of simultaneously executing multiple tasks in a single application.

Thread:
A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled and executed independently by the operating system.
A process can have multiple threads running concurrently.

**Example of Multitasking and  Multithreading**

Imagine a manager who assigns four projects to four teams. Each team works independently on its project, ensuring all
four projects are completed simultaneously. This represents MULTITASKING, where each team is like a process working
in parallel. Now, within each team, members collaborate to complete their assigned projectâ€”one member writes code,
another designs the UI, a third tests the application, and so on. These team members are like THREADS, working
together on different parts of the same project concurrently. At the end, the team delivers a complete project.

There are two ways of implementing threads
1. By extending the Thread class : Shown in Example1
2. By implementing the Runnable Interface: Shown in Example2

Now, lifecycle of a thread:
1. NEW- when the object of the thread is created.
2. RUNNABLE: When the start method is called, it is ready to run.
3. RUNNING: When is thread is being executed by the CPU.
4. BLOCK/WAITING: When a thread is either waiting for a resource or waiting for another thread to execute.
5. TERMINATED: When the thread is finished executing then its in the TERMINATED state.


Methods in Thread
1. start()- starts the thread
2. join()- causes the current thread to pause execution until t 's thread terminates.
3. sleep()-pauses the execution of a current thread for a specified time.
4. setPriority()- if there are multiple threads it sets priority of low , normal , high
5. interrupt()- interrupts the thread and breaks the state of waiting or sleeping thread and throws an Interrupt exception.
6. yield()- giving chance to each thread to execute.


Types of thread
1. User Thread- The thread which does the actual work
2. Daemon Thread- The thread which runs in the background.JVM does not wait for daemon thread.
