Types of error:
1. Syntax Error: Errors which occur because of wrong syntax. Eg: int a=9 here ';' is missing hence syntax error.

2. Logical Error: Errors which occurs when there is some logical issue in the program. Let's understand with an example:
public static int divide(int a , int b){
return a*b ;
}
So the function says to divide but we multiply. Hence logical error.

3. Runtime Error: The program is compiled correctly but during the program runs an error is thrown. It is called runtime
error.
Example given in Test.java


Exception is an error that disrupts the normal flow of a program.It is an object that is thrown in runtime.

Two Types of exceptions:
1.Unchecked exception:These exceptions are not checked at compile time and exceptions will come at runtime. They are a
subclass of Runtime Exception.
Example: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException

2. Checked Exceptions:These exceptions are checked at compile time.The compiler ensures that these exceptions are either
handled using a try-catch block or declared using the throws keyword in the method signature. These are a subclass of
Exception.
Example: FileNotFound, ClassNotFound, IOException



Some important keywords:
throw: to forcefully throw an exception.

throws- It is used in method declaration to specify that this method might throw one or more exceptions.
It informs the compiler that this method ha a potential to throw an exception.

final: to make a variable, methods or classes immutable.

finally: the finally block is always executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception is
thrown or caught. It is used to perform cleanup operations.

finalize:it is a method in Java used to perform cleanup operations before an object is garbage collected.
