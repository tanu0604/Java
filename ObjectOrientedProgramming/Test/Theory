Object Oriented Programming is a type of Programming paradigm. In this, we deal with classes and objects.
Classes are a blueprint or we can say grouped function or behavior.
Objects are instance of a class.

There are 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming:

1. Inheritance: It means inheriting properties or methods  from the parent class. There is a parent class and child
class and the child class inherits all the properties of the parent class and also have its own additional properties
and methods. For example a child inherits the properties like walking , talking, physical appearances from parents.

2. Polymorphism: When an object behaves differently in different place. We can understand from a simple example:
Suppose you are a single indivisual and have different roles.Like you are a child for your parents, a student for your
teacher, and friend to other people.This means you hold multiple roles as a single person.In polymorphism, the parent
class and the child class has same methods and the child class overrides the parent class.

3. Abstraction: It means hiding the complex implementation and showing only the essential features. we can understand
this by an example: We have television in our houses and its remote. We just focus on the remote and television and not
the internal working of the television like  how it works or how does the display shows.

4. Encapsulation: It means encapsulating or binding the data into a single unit. It is used for data hiding. All the
variables or features are private and can be only accessed by getters and setters method. This method is public and
hence we can access those data. At first setters are used to set the data and then getters are used to get the data.
For example the working of the television is hidden and encapsulated.
