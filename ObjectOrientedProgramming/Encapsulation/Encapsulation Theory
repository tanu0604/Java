Here are few important points on encapsulation:

1. Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (variables)
and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts direct access
to some of the object's components, usually through access modifiers like private, protected, and public. This ensures
data security and integrity.

For example:By binding the code (methods) and data (variables) together, encapsulation allows controlled access and
modification through getter and setter methods.It hides the internal details of an object from the outside world,
promoting modularity and maintainability.

2. The getter and setter methods are public and hence can be accessed to set the values and then get them.
